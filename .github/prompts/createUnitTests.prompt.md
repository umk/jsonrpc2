Create or update unit tests using github.com/stretchr/testify package. Test both success and error paths with comprehensive edge cases. Keep the tests implementation as simple as possible. 

Before you even proceed to generating the code, if you encounter a type you're not familiar with, search the codebase to find its implementation so you generate the most accurate tests or mocks.
